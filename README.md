Getting Started
Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local development environment:

    Docker: Installation Guide
    Docker Compose: Installation Guide
    Node.js: Download Node.js

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash
    
    git clone https://github.com/Samchully3002/3clean-backend

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project based on the example below. Make sure to configure the required environment variables.

bash

cp .env.example .env

Build and run the containers:

bash

    docker-compose up --build

    The Express.js server will be running on http://localhost:3000.

Features

    CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on MongoDB.
    Redis Caching: Improve performance by caching frequently accessed data.
    Dockerized: Easily deploy the entire stack with Docker and Docker Compose.

Architecture Overview

The application is structured to follow a microservice-like architecture, using Docker containers for each of the key components:

    Express.js: Serves as the backend API.
    MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store user and data records.
    Redis: A key-value store used as a caching layer.
